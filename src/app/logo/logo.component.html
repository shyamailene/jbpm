                <h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">The non-profit Shakti-US in its mission states its philosophy, belief and goals to be for the advancement of Gender Equality and Women’s empowerment.  Achieving this through promoting leadership and mentoring from rural and underdeveloped regions in the form of Education, Improving Healthcare, Social and Economic advancement. Hence the non-profits choice of the name SHAKTI and logo Sri Yantra/Sri Chakra.  
				</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
SHAKTI in Sanskrit means ‘’power, ability, strength, might, effort, energy, and capability”.  Sri Yantra also known as Sri Chakra, is a geometrical symbolism of the word SHAKTI. It represents our human body at a microcosmic level through the geometrical design in relation to the cosmos at a macrocosmic level.  It depicts gender equality, awareness of one’s potential, purpose in life and ultimate enlightenment of one’s roots, which is more than their ancestry.
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
Empowerment of the sexes, rights and amendments are dependent on social and political issues. However, whether or not they exist, we need to think of ourselves as individuals with potential, strengths and qualities, irrespective of being male or female. Rather than seeing ourselves as part of a political and social environment, we need to see ourselves as part of the human civilization and rediscover our contribution to further development of human civilization individually and collectively as a society.</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
Women certainly have a big role to play in the development of human civilization. A woman is considered to be the first guru, and as the child’s first teacher the mother can change the Samskaras (Habits and Behaviors through well thought out actions) and Karmas (deeds) of a person. Education received from a Guru can enable changes in the intellect, mind, emotions and performance ability. The education received from the mother can create better habits, healthy mentality, for a better life. Gurus and women can both work as very powerful forces to bring about a dramatic, qualitative change in human society. Therefore, Emphasis of one’s role in terms of gender is irrelevant, thinking about one’s role as a human being to uplift others, is the answer for a balanced healthy society.

                <h2 class="title">What is Sri Yantra/Shri Chakra-Meaning and Symbolism</h2>
                <h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">The Sri Yantra’s documented age is more than 12,000-year-old. It is a Geometrical symbol and is considered the mother of all Yantra’s. Yantra’s are geometrical designs based on the principles of sacred geometry and have been typically used for meditation. Yantra is a visual Mantra (verbal repetition or positive affirmation).  It is a symbol or icon of the mother universe in a geometric form. It can be viewed in a circle mandala (flat) form and pyramidal 3D form for the viewer to attain higher state of awareness. Each Yantra design contains a center point or “dot” from which geometric shapes and designs radiate. Traditionally, such symbols were used to balance the left and right aspects of the brain, to focus our minds to obtain spiritual enlightenment.  </h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px"> 
	Sri Yantra maps a seeker’s spiritual journey from the earthly plane to final enlightenment; from the outer rectangles to the central dot, i.e. center of the Universe, the place of origin and unity where one merges with the supreme consciousness. Sri Chakra is a celebrated Yantra used in the worship of the primordial energy. The Chakra is conceived as a symbol of the human body and represents gender equality.  This was considered to be a sacred pattern of a dot, triangle’s, circles, vertical horizontal and diagonal lines, Square and petals in a circle. It contains all forms of sacred geometry/golden ratio, which is mathematically precise and also represents the union of the Masculine and Feminine energies (The upward triangles meeting the downward triangles). This unity of Masculine and Feminine is also seen in other symbols such as the Star of David. This unity and synchronicity is achievable through meditation. 
 </h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px"> 	
This sacred pattern is what the sages of the Siddha Yoga and their disciples used to discover the secrets of our universe and they proposed that the Sri Yantra/Sri Chakra is the key to understanding the principles of creation and destruction, and human potential in relation to the Universe.  
 </h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px"> 
Sri Yantra’s geometrical symbolism and components describe that as Human beings there is no difference between both male and female genders. Yoga aspires to harness the human potential rather than defining both genders roles in the society or civilization. Whenever a need has emerged, society has given full opportunities to both sexes. It was our social, cultural and religious environment in the past that created certain adverse attitudes and mentalities which went against the social environment and changes in gender equality and Yantra principle evolved.

				<h2 class="title">Components of the Sri Yantra/Sri Chakra </h2>
                <h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
					In summary, the Sri Yantra is a geometrical symbol that is comprised of 9 interlocking triangles forming 43 intersected triangles, which include diagonal, vertical, horizontal lines and with 2 circles of lotus petals. The entire design is surrounded by a gated square frame that is referred to as the “earth’s citadel”. The triangles are centered around the central point of the Sri Yantra, known as the Bindu in a tiny dot form.  This geometrical pattern is called the Mandala and represents the world’s energy.  We start the description from the outer side of Sri Yantra and proceed towards its inner details. </h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px"><br/>
The outer side of Sri Yantra contains a square with 8 sides. The square represents the physical body. The 8 corners of the square are the 8 directional deities, starting from top in clock-wise direction, Kubera-protector of world (North), Esaana (North-East), Indra-rain and thunder (East), Agni-Fire (South-East), Yama-deity of Death(South), Nirruti-Analytical knowledge (South-West), Varuna-water (West) and Vaayu – Wind (North-West). These 8 deities are elements present in our physical body. Any excess or deficit in one or more of these elements will lead to diseases and destruction of the physical body. The earth’s square has 3 layers at its outside. These layers represent Tamah (baser qualities), Rajah (anger and desires) and Satwah (softness). These 3 qualities are always attached to the human body. </h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px"><br/>
From this earth square, we move towards the center of Sri Yantra, we see 3 concentric circles. The outer circle represents Manah (mind), the next one represents Buddhi (intelligence), and the innermost circle represents the Jeevatma (human soul). The significance of this: our wavering mind should apply its intelligence and find the ways to understand the soul. Once we get the awareness of the soul in our body, we are ready to tap into the subtle energies of our body. Our body is a vast reservoir of different types of energies like light, heat and sound. The numerous nerves of the human body circulate these energies and are finally connected to brain through the spinal cord. These nerves meet in bundles at the spinal cord and these regions are called Chakras which are viewed as reservoirs of energy. These chakras are represented in the form of petals as detailed below. </h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">

Then we proceed to the 16 petals of Sri Yantra: that represent Kaama (desire), Buddhi (intelligence), Ahankaara (ego), Sabda (hearing), Sparsa (touch), Roopa (sight), Rasa (taste), Gandha (smell), Chittha (mind), Dhairya (courage), Smirtya (memory), Naama (name), Beeja (fire), Aatma (soul), Amrita (water) and Sareera (body). These are the elements (or different form of energies) through which our Jeevatma (human soul) understands and interacts with the outside world. We can attain mastery over these elements by meditating and balancing the chakra energies in our body through meditation and yoga, which can aide a normal human being then gets some supernatural powers called ‘siddhis’ powers. <br/>


The next layer of 8 petals of the inner circle represents the 8 Siddhis (powers). They are Anima (smallness), Laghima (bigness), Garima (heaviness), Mahima (creativity), Easatva (devotion or piety), Vasatva (impulse control), Praakamya (fulfilling the objective) and Iccha (willfulness). Using these energies, we can perform activities of daily routine and when they are refined, we can attain supernatural powers.
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
Next layer is the interlaced triangles. Each triangle is formed with 3 straight lines resulting in 3 vertices. These vertices denote Jnaana-knowledge through meditation (Iym), Kriya- Breath controlled practices (Hreem) and Iccha- willfulness (Sreem). There are 4 upward triangles representing Siva (the male force) and the 5 downward triangles represent the female force, called Shakti (the female force). When 4 upward and 4 downward triangles are taken, they are balanced. They represent that this entire Universe is emerged from Siva and Shakti. The one remaining downward triangle represents Mother Nature. We live in this Nature and feel that this is the only real world. This feeling is called Maaya (illusion). Once we come out of this illusion, we will be able to understand balance of the male and female strength.  The intersected triangles are also denoted as energy reservoirs which release and store energy they are 43 in total. 
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
		Lastly, the Dot (Bindu) is in the center of the Sri Yantra. Sit with your eyes closed and start visualizing a dot in the top centre of your head. This place represents the Sahasraara (crown chakra). When we concentrate on this crown chakra, we will be able to come out of Maaya (Illusion) and connect our Jeevathma (bodily soul) to the all-pervading Supreme soul. This is called ‘Samaadhi’ (dwelling in the devotion). Thus, Sri Yantra becomes an instrument for mankind to unite into the Supreme soul.

				Thus, ends the description of the meaning of the components of the Sri Yantra/Sri Chakra.<br/>

			<h2 class="title">Purposes of the Sri Chakra and its Scientific Applications in recent times:  </h2>
                <h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
										These Mandala’s have been used for centuries as a component of tantric meditation practice. The geometric unity within the pieces reflects the unity of the individual with the surrounding universe, and this pattern of repetition has long been shown to help balance the mind. In meditation each step of the mandala is considered, and the self is encouraged to recognize the process of merging with surrounding energies. </h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
		However, the Sri Yantra can also have meaning in psycho-therapeutic practice, as a way to help individuals consider the geometric patterns that underlie everyday life, and as a symbolic path to understanding the elements that make a person whole in treating various illnesses with the mind and body. 
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
		Examples of the other uses are in Vedic Astrology and Vastu-Sastra which is the study of the directions to build a house or a dwelling.  The Sri Yantra is used in Medicine, Dentistry, Art, Music, Engineering, Mathematics and Psychology and Physics. 
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
Medical example: The PINEAL gland and the Sri Yantra: Staring at the central dot or ‘Bindu’ of the Sri Yantra is known and proven to create changes within the brain and the stimulation of the Pineal gland by focusing our attention on the ‘center of the forehead’ area. The Pineal gland is a small endocrine gland in the brain. It produces Melatonin, a Serotonin derived hormone, which affects the modulation of sleep patterns in both seasonal and circadian rhythms. Its shape resembles a tiny pine cone (hence its name), and it is located in the Epithalamus, near the center of the brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join. Rene Descartes believed the pineal gland to be the “principal seat of the soul” and viewed it as the third eye.
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
The Sri Yantra is considered to be a symbol of immense power partly because when one meditates for prolonged periods on it, one can focus their attention on the area between their eyebrows which stimulates the pineal gland, which increases the alpha brain wave activity (this fact is based on controlled EEG studies at Moscow University). The Sri Yantra amongst other forms of Pineal gland stimuli could be the most important thing to feel the superhuman self.
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
The Sri Yantra’s mathematically precise design is based upon Golden Proportion or Phi ratio. Everything that exists in nature, is constructed in a proportionately precise manner and this proportion is called the Golden/Phi ratio. It is a simple mathematical relationship found naturally and in many great works of art (Leonardo Di Vinci’s Vitruvian man and The Mona Lisa) and even architecture such as the positioning of the Pyramids of Giza.
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
The beauty of someone’s face is also based upon these Golden Proportions, and even the shape and position of their front teeth (felt obliged to throw that one in being a Dentist!). The technology company Apple also used Golden Proportion when designing their products to make them more appealing to the customers eyes. Our bodies are also roughly based on this Golden Proportion. In simple terms, the Golden Ratio suggests that everything, starting from the tiniest speck, expands and grows in proportions of 1.618, from a microscopic level to a macroscopic level for increased stability and beauty. Famous mathematicians, such as Pythagorus, also commented on the Golden Ratio and it being the blueprint applied to all of creation.
</h5><br/><h5 class="card-description text-justify" style="text-indent:50px">
Even sound and our hearing follow’s this same ratio and follows the Golden Proportion. The finest music known to man is also based on Golden Proportion. Some scientists found that the Acoustical Engineering tests of the sound of OM illustrated the Sri Chakra/Sri Yantra.
